# Validation Status & Known Issues

## Independent Review Results

This project has been reviewed by independent AI systems (GPT and Claude) to verify physics and numerical claims.

### ‚úÖ Validated Concepts
- Core idea of testing extra dimensions with gravitational waves is sound
- BSSN numerical relativity implementation is correctly structured
- Phase differences between BBH and BNS could reveal extra dimensions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Identified & Being Fixed

1. **Dimensional Analysis**
   - Issue: KK coupling term not properly dimensionless
   - Status: Fix in progress
   - Impact: Equations need correction but concept valid

2. **LIGO Sensitivity Claims**
   - Claimed: 10‚Åª‚Å∂ radian phase precision
   - Reality: ~0.1 radian for typical events
   - Impact: Need 1000x more events than initially stated

3. **Amplitude Scaling**
   - Issue: Strain values ~10¬π‚Å∞ times too small
   - Status: Reviewing wave extraction code
   - Impact: Numerical issue, not physics problem

4. **Statistical Requirements**
   - Original: 100 events for discovery
   - Revised: 10,000+ events needed
   - Timeline: O6/O7 runs (2030s) not O4/O5

### üìã Fix Checklist
- [ ] Correct dimensional analysis in KK equations
- [ ] Update LIGO sensitivity assumptions
- [ ] Fix strain amplitude scaling
- [ ] Revise statistical requirements
- [ ] Clarify brane-world vs pure KK theory
- [ ] Verify unit conversions

## Current Project Status

**Theory**: ‚úÖ Valid (with clarifications needed)
**Numerics**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs fixes (but salvageable)
**Detectability**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Harder than claimed (but possible)
**Code**: ‚úÖ Core implementation solid

## For Contributors

If you want to help fix these issues:
1. See `FIX_REQUEST_FOR_NEXT_CLAUDE.md` for detailed tasks
2. Check GitHub Issues for specific problems
3. Run validation tests after any changes

## Bottom Line

The dream of detecting extra dimensions with gravitational waves is alive, but we need to be more rigorous about the claims. This is cutting-edge science - let's get it right!
